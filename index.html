<h2 id="director-of-site-reliability-engineering">Director of Site Reliability Engineering</h2>
<p>I am an IT expert with over 18 years of professional experience. My career began as a full-time developer then slowly transitioned into a full-time SysAdmin. This range of skills has given me a unique perspective on the DevOps philosophy and how it best fits within an organization.</p>
<h2 id="my-next-move">My Next Move</h2>
<p>I am looking for a small startup with a lot of interesting problems to solve. Ideally a company looking to bring their tech in-house and need an engineer to hit the ground running as their CTO.</p>
<h2 id="management-style">Management Style</h2>
<p>I am very task and deadline oriented. I do not manage people’s time, I look to make sure they are given the proper tasks that best fits their skills. I let them manage their own time. I also believe it is every senior level person’s responsiblity to lift up the junior and mid-level engineers so they make beome senior themselves.</p>

<ul>
<li>Participated in the entire release life-cycle of the Hinge reboot. From the initial product inception to the first release and beyond.</li>
<li>Docker Lead/SME: Brought in Docker to replace Chef/Ansible configuration. All developers now have a complete working environment they can spin up via Docker Compose. All Go-based applications are managed via AWS Container Serivce, while the Python based docker containers are managed via a home-grown solution I wrote.</li>
<li>Created a fully automated deployment pipeline (<code>Commit</code>-&gt;<code>Test</code>-&gt;<code>CI</code>-&gt;<code>Deployment</code>). Developers can tag branches which will create docker containers and deployment them safely to production. Built in Go using Consul at first, then transitioned to Amazon ECS, then finally to Kubernetes where it is now.</li>
<li>Created Microservice Architecture: Application config and service discovery is managed through Consul, HTTP traffic is routed through Fabio and gRPC traffic is handled via Consul DNS. Service communicate via protocol buffers/gRPC or HTTP/JSON.</li>
<li>Created performance-critical portions of the architecture with Go based mircoservices. Reduced TCO further by replacing Python services with Go.</li>
<li>Created the entire backend in one month for the Hinge Matchmaker stand-alone product.</li>
<li>AWS Lead/SME: Replaced entire Heroku infrastructure with a complete AWS solution. Implemented and manages over 15 separate AWS solutions from EC2 to RDS to CloudFront. All managed via CloudFormation.</li>
<li>Brought Google’s Deep Learning tool TensorFlow into the recommendation service. Machine Learning is done live and recommendations are served in real-time.</li>
<li>In-House Penetration Tester and Security SME</li>
